My career has been dedicated to addressing climate and environmental challenges through technology. Over the years, I’ve built systems that combine blockchain, AI, and data science to enable trustable, efficient climate finance at scale using decentralized systems.  

It started in 2013 with R for organizational statistics, then in 2015 I moved into analytics, building an AI based algorithm to monitor sustainability KPIs and operational performance. By 2018, I was designing and developing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains, ensuring compliance with national regulations for security tokens and integrating DIDs for trust and identity.  

I expanded this work into Cardano, refining dApp architecture, token design, and off-chain data integrations for climate focused use cases, including platforms supporting ESG aligned impact measurement and tokenization for reforestation and conservation projects. 

Later, I’ve developed dMRV systems for forest carbon projects, integrating satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and on the ground inventories to estimate carbon stock changes under VCS/IPCC methodologies. My work at Pachama builds on this, optimizing AI workflows that combine machine learning, remote sensing, and forestry science to support reforestation and ecological integrity assessments. In 2020, I co designed and validated a novel AI powered bioinformatics pipeline alongside a microfluidic bioreactor system that achieved a 99% land-use reduction in food production with plant stem cell cultures, offering a scalable solution to address deforestation and environmental degradation.

I’ve also explored quantum computing with Rigetti’s Python SDKs, assessing hybrid classical quantum workflows for environmental modeling and optimization problems.
