# Hey! 

I'm a Climate Tech Web3 & AI Data Engineer, and live in beautiful Patagonia Argentina. Since 2015, I’ve built systems that combine blockchain, AI, and data science to enable trustable, efficient climate finance at scale. My career has been dedicated to addressing climate and environmental challenges through technology.

Contributed from AI-powered bioinformatics and Ethereum security tokens, to developing dMRV systems and climate tokenization on Cardano and Pachama.

I ❤️ hiking, drone photography and expeditions.

**Achievements:**  
It started in 2013 with R for organizational statistics, then in 2015 I moved into analytics, building an AI based algorithm to monitor sustainability KPIs and operational performance. By 2018, I was designing and developing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains, ensuring compliance with national regulations for security tokens and integrating DIDs for trust and identity. In 2020, I co designed and validated a novel AI powered bioinformatics pipeline alongside a microfluidic bioreactor system that achieved a 99% land-use reduction in food production with plant stem cell cultures, offering a scalable solution to address deforestation and environmental degradation. Later, I expanded work into Cardano, refining dApp architecture, token design, and off-chain data integrations for climate focused use cases, including platforms supporting ESG aligned impact measurement and tokenization for reforestation and conservation projects. Lastly, I’ve developed dMRV systems for forest carbon projects, integrating satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and on the ground inventories to estimate carbon stock changes under VCS/IPCC methodologies with my work at Pachama, optimizing AI workflows that combine machine learning, remote sensing, and forestry science to support reforestation and ecological integrity assessments.
