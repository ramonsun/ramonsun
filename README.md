# Hello! üëã 

I'm a Climate Tech Web3 & AI Data Engineer, and live in beautiful Patagonia Argentina. Since 2015, I‚Äôve built systems that combine blockchain, AI, and data science to enable trustable, efficient climate finance at scale. My career has been dedicated to addressing climate and environmental challenges through technology.

Contributed from AI-powered bioinformatics and Ethereum security tokens, to developing dMRV systems and climate tokenization on Cardano and Pachama.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è hiking, drone photography & expeditions.

Keen on building sustainable solutions? Reach out!

**Highlights:**  
‚Ä¢ Developed an AI algorithm to monitor organizational impact KPIs and operational performance since 2015. 
‚Ä¢ Designed & deployed smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains for security tokens, ensuring compliance with national regulations and integrating DIDs for trust and identity. 
‚Ä¢ Co designed and validated a novel AI powered bioinformatics pipeline and microfluidic bioreactor system, achieving a 99% land use reduction in food production with plant stem cells, to address deforestation. 
‚Ä¢ Refined Cardano dApp architecture and token design for ESG aligned impact measurement and tokenization of reforestation/conservation projects.
‚Ä¢ Developed dMRV systems for forest carbon projects, optimizing AI workflows (ML, Remote Sensing, LiDAR) to estimate carbon stock changes under VCS/IPCC methodologies, with Pachama.
